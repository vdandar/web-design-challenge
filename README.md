FOR THE CASE ASSIGNMENT:

A few notes as to file organization:
All main html pages are labelled as: index, viz1-4, data, and comparisons. There is a "styles" css file. There are some additional peices such as the icons and site.webmanifest file haivng to do with creating the weather icon at the top of the web page tab.

I wasnt sure if you wanted us to take snapshots of the site at the various screen widths or not, but you can see the changes per the CSS file. In sum: The Nav Bar changes look and accessibility at a width of 991px and lower whereby it transforms to the teal background and condensed left menu. The content on the pages change layout at 767px to 576px whereby the sidebar vizualizations will wrap under the main image, but the gray container is still maintained. At under 576px, the gray container disappears and content is only featured with a white background and the wrapped images.
